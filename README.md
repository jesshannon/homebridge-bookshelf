# homebridge-bookshelf

Plugin for [homebridge](https://homebridge.io/).

This plugin controls addressable LED strips via a [FadeCandy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1689) board. It exposes a few different accessories as smart devices to HomeKit or Alexa/Google via another plugin. 

The FadeCandy project appears to be dead but the boards are still available from a few retailers, it's an easy way to drive up to 8 separate WS281x strips from a Pi.
